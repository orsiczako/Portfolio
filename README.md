Implemented three sections for the portfolio website, with content added to the first section. The remaining sections are still under development, requiring additional content and modifications. Integrated scroll-based animations where sections fade in and out as the user scrolls through the page. Additionally, began working on the mobile navigation bar (hamburger menu) functionality, which will be updated to improve performance and responsiveness across devices.
